# Hello World in WebR

To get started, download or pull this repo. Also, make sure you have Python3 installed. You don't need to write Python code for this to work; we just need Python to write two lines of Terminal code that will allow you to see this test code locally in your browser.

Then, in the terminal, navigate to where this repo is stored and run

```
chmod +x launch_server.sh
```

then,

```
./launch_server.sh
```

Now, open a web browser (I've worked mostly with Chrome) and type "http://localhost:8000" into the URL bar.
